          <p>In 2019, a new trend swept the internet encouraging social media users to look up the phrase “Florida Man” along with their birth date in order to be presented with a humorous article detailing some bizarre hijinks that took place in the titular state. Users would then share their results and join with others in mocking the headlines, but their backdrop in the Sunshine State provided a certain logic to the whole joke: of course such wacky events occurred in such an odd place (Cohen). However, many of these users failed to realize that Florida proved unique not in its shenanigans, but in its public record laws that made reporting on outlandish arrests more readily available than in other states (Norman). Many of the so-called “Florida Men” in the articles came from vulnerable positions, often struggling with poverty, mental illness, and drug addiction before their editorial debuts. With no tangible connection to each other, the imagery around Florida bound them together, congealing people’s low points into some greater proof that the peninsula breeds the obscene and peculiar. Their actions could no longer be separated from their geographic context. With each publication, the subjects no longer existed as Florida residents, but became enshrined as Florida Men with all the swirling connotations of insanity and mischief that follow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-text" id="subHead">
        <p>The Florida Man journalistic category emerged as part of a long legacy of painting the peninsula as a transient, zany place where anything can happen. Some trace this lineage to the hanging chad controversy of the US presidential election in 2000 (Norman), but it also follows a pattern of characterization that began with the land’s colonization in the early 16th century. For nearly half a millenium, Florida has served as a site of potential, becoming, and adventure. With this project, I argue that the Sunshine state has its current reputation not because it awakens a craze within its residents, but because it has been the center of imperial land disputes for nearly half a millennium.</p>
      </div>

        </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <p>Upon putting numerous depictions of the peninsula in conversation with each other, a few themes recur in Florida's history. They are:
          <ul>
            <li>Searches for Wellbeing and Vitality</li>
            <li>Dehumanization of Natives</li>
            <li>Dominance of Whiteness</li>
            <li>Visiting Paradise</li>
            <li>Moral Depravity</li>
          </ul> </p>
          <p>These commonalities arise so frequently and consistently because they have an unbreakable influence over each other. The dominance of whiteness and its searches for wellbeing and vitality bring passersby to visit a supposed paradise, where their relief relies on the dehumanization of the land's original inhabitants. Time passes, the wound festers, and depravity begins darting in front of the transient onlooker, taking whatever different forms it needed to repulse and intrigue in its liminal lair. With the following media collection, I hope to demonstrate my theory that it is the collision of these historical motifs that has yielded a peculiar discursive phenomenon that manifested in "Florida Man." </p>

          <p>This research follows the understanding that the constant coming together of different discursive patterns and geopolitical occurrences forms the conceptions of a location in a collective consciousness. American studies as a field has long sought to reconcile the forces of the imperial imagination with its material impacts on its subjects. Approaching this work with an intersectional lens allows us to understand that this manifestation of thought, in tandem with racialized capitalism, disproportionately affects Indigenous, Black, and Latine peoples both in the mainland and overseas. The same can be expected of the way people discuss Florida, where a centuries-old bias in favor of settler colonists has fundamentally shaped the state’s development. As such, this endeavor requires anti-colonial, Marxist, and Black feminist frameworks in order to do its subjects justice and parse through the marginalization of certain crucial perspectives in Florida history.</p>
          <p>Overall, I seek to develop a clear picture of Florida as it has existed in the imperial imagination from the time of its invasion to the present day and to explore the ways that intangible impression has manifested in the lives of the peninsula’s residents. In my research, I hope to answer the following questions: how can we define Florida in the national and international imaginations? What are its defining characteristics, and how do they lend themselves to stereotypes? How can we extend the lessons of this study to our engagement with the world as a whole as members of the imperial core?</p>

          <p>The peninsula that we now call Florida was originally home to a number of Indigenous groups, including the Calusa, Tequesta, Miccosukee, Ais, Jeaga, Mayaimi, Timucua, Tocobaga, and Apalachee peoples. In the 1500s, Spanish conquistadors arrived and began a violent process of colonization, but were met with great resistance from locals. French forces also began establishing themselves in the area in the same century. European domination severely impacted the populations of the peninsula’s natives, with many ethnic groups experiencing complete genocide. In the 1700s, however, the Seminole Tribe of Florida emerged as a powerful, resistant coalition that still has great influence in the modern day. In that same century, Florida came under British control, though Spain still maintained a strong presence. In 1821, the peninsula came under US governance and in 1845, it officially became a state.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Many Americans buy into the old myth that Florida was “discovered” by Juan Ponce de Léon in 1513 during a search for the fountain of youth. This was perhaps one of the oldest misconceptions about the Sunshine State to enter the colonial imaginations of various European superpowers. Old records described the conquistador as having searched for fresh water and cures for sexual dysfunction, but the fountain of youth became part of the legend in the late 16th century after Ponce de Léon’s death as fact and fantasy blurred together in story (Allman). This marked one of the earliest portrayals of Florida as a place full of the potential for harnessing infinity, but also reflects the instability of the peninsula’s supposed truth.</p>
          <p>Italian scholar Peter Martyr d'Anghiera described Ponce de León's supposed search for the Fountain of Youth in his work "De Orbe Novo Decades," the first history of Europe's arrival in what we now call America, published in 1530 (Sullivan & Lane). He writes:</p>
          <p><strong>"I am taking the liberty of relating and setting down in writing that which men of highest authority do not hesitate to affirm orally. My authorities unanimously declare that they have heard of the fountain which restores vigor, believing somewhat in those who told about it. They have a Bahaman servant called Andrés the Bearded, because he ended up with a beard among his beardless countrymen. It is told that he was born of a very aged father, who from his native island near the region of Florida, attracted by the fame of that fountain and by the desire to prolong his life, having made preparations for the trip in the same way as our people go from Rome to the baths of Puteoli in Naples to recover their health, he left to take the longed-for waters of that fountain." (1530)</strong></p>
          <p>Martyr calls upon an ethos-based argument to ground his claims as he excitedly cites both his higher-ups and the local islander who serves as their primary source. This appears to be the 16th century equivalent of the classic citation, "my friend's friend told me." It is worth noting that the person who makes the fountain of youth known to the settler imagination is a Bahaman descended from a man who moved between the isles and the mainland in search of vitality. This offers a parallel to the important role of Caribbean immigrants in modern-day Florida. Martyr also harkens to Italy, likening a trip to the fountain with the bathhouse habits of his people. This in turn presents another parallel to the Sunshine State's status as a tourist destination for the elite. The perspectives of both the servant and the historian reveal early characterizations of Florida as a transient place, somewhere to be traveled to and from for the sake of pushing the limits of one's mortality.</p>

<!-- Portrayal of Indigenous Folks

      <h2>The Settler Eye on Florida's First Residents</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <div class="about-text">
        <p>As often occured in New World historiography, the Indigenous peoples of Florida were portrayed as lesser than their colonizers and particularly aggressive, largely due to their continued resistance to European invasion. In his 1542 account "Los Naufragíos", Spanish conquistador Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca describes his interactions with various conflicting native groups in northwestern Florida. He refers to Indigenous burial practices as idolatry and attributes a conniving nature to the locals' war practices (Cabeza de Vaca). Describing a different expedition, "The Narrative of the Expedition of Hernando de Soto" by the Gentleman of Elvas recounts the battle capabilities of other Florida natives as such:</p>  
        <p><strong>"The Indians are exceedingly ready with their weapons, and so warlike and nimble, that they have no fear of footmen; for if these charge them they flee, and when they turn their backs they are presently upon them. They avoid nothing more easily than the flight of an arrow. They never remain quiet, but are continually running, traversing from place to place, so that neither crossbow nor arquebuse can be aimed at them. Before a Christian can make a single shot with either, an Indian will discharge three or four arrows; and he seldom misses of his object." (1557)</strong></p>
        <p>Both authors saw the peninsula's original inhabitants as tricky, violent people distinct from Christians. However, not all recollections describe them so unfavorably. Frenchman Jean Ribault's 1563 account of meeting natives in "The Whole and True Discoverye of Terra Florida" held a kinder tone. He writes:</p>
        <p><strong>"And as I began to go towardes him, he sett fourthe and came and receved me gentlye and reoised [rejoiced] after there mannour, all his men ffolowing him with great silence and modestie, yea, with more than our men did." (1563)</strong></p>  
        <p>While the Spaniards described the locals based on the tensions of colonial violence that surrounded them, Ribault wrote of the aid they gave his French expedition and the pleasantries he felt towards them. This juxtaposition illustrates the dynamic nature of the peninsula's original inhabitants and the shifting manner in which they were portrayed.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>French artist Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues traveled to Florida on France's second expedition in the mid 16th century and produced some of history's most well-known depictions of the native Timucua people in a set of engravings. The above image from 1564, <em>The Floridians Worship the Column Set Up By The Captain On The First Voyage,</em> shows the Timucua bestowing praise and offerings upon a decorated column left behind by Ribault. The artist's accompanying comments attribute dignity to the natives and largely focus on describing their war customs. The lower image, <em>Satouriwa's Ceremonies before Going to War (plate 2),</em> depicts the local chief Satouriwa leading his men through a ritual encouraging them to shed their enemy's blood.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Seen above, in <em>Their Hunting of Deer, </em> Le Moyne portrayed the Timucua cleverly hunting deer from under pelts to camoflage themselves, remarking that he had never seen anything like it [citation]. He regarded the extensive skills and wisdom the native hunters employed in combat with awe.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>In <em>Requests Made of the Chief by Women Whose Husbands Have Been Killed In Battle Or Carried Off By Disease,</em> Le Moyne captures the following mourning custom:</p>
          <p><strong>"The wives of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease are accustomed to gather on a day that they judge to be somwhat favorable for addressing the chief. Approaching him with much grief and
            wailing they squat on their heels and cover their faces with their hands, and with loud cries and pleadings
            seek vengeance of the chief for their dead husbands. They ask for assistance, so that they can maintain a
            livelihood as widows, and permission to marry again at the time prescribed by law. The chief has pity on
            them and grants their request. They return home weeping and wailing as a sign of the love they bore their
            husbands. When they have spent some days in mourning, and have taken to their husbands’ graves their
            weapons and the cup they used to drink from, they weep afresh and carry out other womanly customs." (1564)</strong></p>
          <p>Le Moyne offered slightly more humanizing depictions of Florida's Indigenous people than most of his Spanish or British contemporaries did, but his gaze still wavered between reverence, exoticization, and denigration. The artist's commentary recalling Timucua culinary practices for <em>Preparations For A Feast</em> reveals a characterization of the people that echoes the recurring legend of supernatural Floridian vitality: </p>
          <p><strong>"However, although they hold great feasts in their own way, yet they are temperate in their
            eating, as a result of which they live for a long time. For one of their chiefs assured me that he was three
            hundred years old, and that his father, whom he showed me, was fifty years older than he; and I can truly
            say, that when I saw him, I thought I was looking at no more than human bones covered with skin. They
            certainly put Christians to shame who reduce their span of life by holding immoderate feasts and drinking
            parties, and who deserve to be handed over for training to these base uncivilized people and brutish
            creatures in order to learn restraint." (1564)</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6"> <img src="img/FeastTimucua.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>While the French benefited from some good favor with the Timucua, the British were met with more hostility in their expansionist endeavors. While on a trip to Philadelphia in 1696, Jamaican English merchant Jonathan Dickinson encountered a hurricane that left himself, his crew, and his wife stranded on the Floridian shore. His characterization of the natives he encountered included some of the following excerpts:</p>
            <p><strong>"About the eighth or ninth hour came two Indian men... from the southward, running fiercely and foaming at the mouth having no weapons except their knives...."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>"Their countenance was furious and bloody."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>"I bethought myself to give them some tobacco and pipes, which the greedily snatched from me, and making a snuffing noise like a wild beast, turned their backs upon us and run away."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>"We communed together and considered our condition, being amongst a barbarous people such as were generally accounted maneaters...." (1696)</strong></p>
            <p>Such animalistic portrayals served to further dehumanize the peninsula's Indigenous peoples in the settler imagination and justify continued efforts to commit genocide by multiple national forces. These were the first Floridians to be made into something they were not.</p>

          <p><strong>None of these maps display even remotely similar borders.</strong> The land’s swampy quality, enmeshed among ocean and mangrove trees, brought many early colonizers to believe that it was an archipelago, and as such its portrayal in many old maps shows a conglomeration of islands that shifted in placement from publisher to publisher (Navakas 245).</p>
          <p>This cartographic fluidity helped establish the transient and unstable characterization of the peninsula. While the rest of the colonial US was embracing a continental status as a solid, unified mainland, watery Florida stood in contrast: dispersed, elucive, and confusing.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Incessantly following the legacy set by the legend of Ponce de Léon, vacationers have long flocked to Florida in search of improved health and longevity. The 1764 speech, <em>A Proclamation by His Excellency James Grant Governor and Commander in Chief [of the Province East Florida],</em> makes the following declaration on behalf of the British king:</p>
          <p><strong>"I do in this proclamation further publish and make known that the former inhabitants lived to great Ages. His Majesty's troops since their taking possession of it have enjoyed an uninterrupted state of Good health. Fevers which are so common during the autumn in other parts of America are not known here." (1764)</strong></p>
          <p>This oration serves as one of the earliest records of someone directly advertising a move to Florida for its health benefits, and it was followed by many similar announcements in countless other pieces of travel literature over the centuries. These claims relied primarily on the belief that the peninsula's climate and wildlife had a healing effect on people. An increased focus on one's wellbeing coincided with the rise of romantic era ideals promoting newfound admiration for undisturbed landscapes. Many believed spending time in a place as beautiful as Florida would ail their maladies. At the same time, many colonists began projecting their romantic ideals about nature onto the very people they were displacing. Though they write of Florida's Natives in pleasant tones and poetic language, their depictions still often rely upon the "noble savage" trope that regards Indigenous people as less fit for civilization than Europeans. Having witnessed the Seminoles and other groups fight so fiercely to maintain their homes, non-Natives intrinsically associated their neighbors with violent disputes over what they saw as paradise for their taking and often lacked remorse for the conditions of their fellow man.</p>
          <p>In his 1791 book, <em>The Travels of William Bartram,</em> the titular author describes his naturalist journey and eventual love for Florida, pondering its role to the Natives:</p>
          <p><strong>"How happily situated is this retired spot of earth! What an elisium it is! where the wandering Siminole, the naked red warrior, roams at large, and after the vigorous chase retires from the scorching heat of the meridian sun. Here he reclines, and reposes under the odoriferous shades of Zanthoxilon, his verdant couch guarded by the Deity; Liberty, and the Muses, inspiring him with wisdom and valor, while the balmy zephyrs fan him to sleep." (1791)</strong></p>
          <p>Bartram's account of the land portrays the Seminole people as fiercesome, transient, unashamed in nudity, and predisposed to leisure. This characterization stems from what he observes to be their relationship with the peninsula's landscape, intertwined with spirituality at the cost of perceived primitivity and settled in stark contrast with the demands of white society. Even as settler armies waged wars to clear Florida of its Native peoples in a demographic sense, its inherent geological conditions could not be removed from their association with the lifestyles of the Natives.</p>
          <p>American soldier George Archibald McCall also admires the Seminoles' relationship to nature in an 1830 excerpt from <em>Letters from the Frontier.</em></p>
          <p><strong>"The Seminole is certainly a shrude yet patient observer, and is wonderfully well-versed, practically, in astronomy and meteorology: he can calculate with more than ordinary accuracy the character of the weather twenty-four or even fourty-eight hours ahead." (1830)</strong></p>
          <p>Renowned naturalist John James Audubon offered a rare piece of sympathy to the peninsula's Natives in his 1834 book, <em>Ornithological Biography:</em></p>
          <p><strong>"The poor dejected son of the woods, endowed with talents of the highest order, although rarely acknowledged by the proud usurpers of his native soil, has spent the night in fishing, and the morning in procuring the superb-feathered game of the swampy thickets; and with both he comes to offer them for our acceptance. Alas! thou fallen one, descendant of an ancient line of freeborn hunters, would that I could restore to thee thy birthright, they natural independence, the generous feelings that were once fostered in thy brave bosom. But the irrevocable deed is done, and I cna merely admire the perfect symmetry of his frame, as he dexterously throws on our deck the trouts and turkeys which he has captured." (1834)</strong></p>
          <p>Not everyone approved of what was becoming of Florida as the 19th century grew older. Some, including famous American author Ralph Waldo Emerson, expressed disdain for the moral failures of Floridians. In an 1827 journal entry about St. Augustine, he writes:</p>
          <p><strong>"Oldest town of Europeans in North America, full of ruins, chimneyless houses. Lazy people, housekeeping intolerably dear, and bad milk from swamp grass because all hay comes from the north. Forty miles from here is, nevertheless, the richest crop of grass growing untouched. Why? Because there is no scythe in St. Augustine, and if there were, no man who knows how to use one!" (1827)</strong></p>
          <p>Others countered such sentiments with an internal enterprise that drove them to work more to change their environment, largely for the supposed good of the white race. In his 1837 guidebook, <em>The Territory of Florida,</em> American lawyer John Lee Williams encourages northerners to migrate to the Sunshine State and toil away:</p>
          <p><strong>"Many Europeans, as well as inhabitants of the northern states, object to live in a slave holding country, and we must hold that slavery is an evil. There is not indeed so great a proportion of slaves here, as in the rest of the southern states; and in general, slaves, with us, are treated with great humanity. But we want industrious and enterprizing men and women to come among us, to set good examples, to prove that white men, although they may not bear the buring rays of the sun as well as negroes, yet that by order, system and economy, thay can accomplish more in one day, than a slave will accomplish in a week." (1837)</strong></p>
          <p>Though Florida's colonization was always racialized, Lee's call to action reveals the extent to white nationalist projects shaped the settlement of the peninsula. In Washington Irving's 1855 book <em>The Seminoles,</em> the classic author, despite having never visited Florida, writes of the interactions between Seminole chief Neamathla and state governor William P. Duval, a fictionalized version of Irving's real friend. Though the author shows some sympathy for the Natives, his support for Indigenous displacement is also clear. This story's place in the archive, where few first-hand recollections from Indigenous and Black Floridians exist, exemplifies the amount of influence wealthy white Americans had over the portrayal of those they deemed "other." In "Origin of the White, the Red, and the Black Men: A Seminole Tradition," Irving writes his version of an 1818 speech delivered to Duval by Neamathla in protest of the US's insistence that Native children receive a white man's education:</p>
          <p><strong>"We have a tradition handed down from our forefathers, and we believe it, that the Great Spirit, when he undertook to make men, made the black man; it was his first attempt, and pretty well for a beginning; but he soon saw he had bungled; so he determined to try his hand again. He did so, and made the red man. He liked him much better than the black man, but still he was not exactly what he wanted. So he tried once more, and made the white man; and then he was satisfied. You see, therefore, that you were made last, and that is the reason I call you my youngest brother."</strong></p>
          <p>The legend goes on to say that the three races of men each received a box of tools that dictated their roles in society.</p>
          <p><strong>"From this it is clear that the Great Spirit intended the white man should learn to read and write; to understand all about the moon and stars, and to make every thing, even rum and whiskey. That the red man should be a first-rate hunter, and a mighty warrior, but he was not to learn anything from books, as the Great Spirit had not given him any; nor was he to make rum and whiskey, lest he should kill himself from drinking. As to the black man, as he had nothing but working-tools, it was clear he was to work for the white and red man, which he has continued to do. We must go according to the wishes of the Great Spirit, or we shall get into trouble. To know how to read and write, is very good for white men, but very bad for red men. It makes white men better, and red men worse. Some of the Creeks and Cherokees learnt to read and write, and they are the greatest rascals among all the Indians.... as [the nation at home] knew not what a treaty was, he held up the little piece of paper, and they looked under it, and lo! it covered a great extent of country, and they found that their brethren, by knowing how to read and write, had sold their houses, and their lands, and the graves of their fathers; and that the white man, by knowing how to read and write, had gained them. Tell our Great Father at Washington, therefore, that we are very sorry we cannot receive teachers among us; for reading and writing, though very good for white men, is very bad for Indians." (1855) </strong></p>
          <p>The accuracy of Irving's version of the Seminole origin story, however, should be questioned. Though this section was written based off an account from Duval himself about his conversation with Neamathla, there are other recollections of the same event that offer a different moral [citation]. An 1842 record of the speech instead wrote:</p>
          <p><strong>"Listen, father, and I will tell you how the Great
            Spirit made man, and how he gave to men of different
            colours the diffe rent employments that we find them
            engaged in. After the world was made it was solitary.
            It was very beautiful; the forests abounded in game
            and fruit: the great plains were covered with deer and
            elk, and buffalo, and the rivers were full of fish; there
            were many bears and beaver, and other fat animals,
            but there was no being to enjoy these good things. Then
            the Master of Life said, we will make man. Man was
            made, but when he stood up before his maker, he was
            white! The Great Spirit was sorry: he saw that the
            being he had made was pale and weak; he took pity on
            him, and therefore did not unmake him, but let him
            live. He tried again, for he was determined to make
            a perfect man, but in his endeavour to avoid making
            another white man, he went into the opposite extreme,
            and when the second being rose up, and stood before
            him, he was black I The Great Spirit liked the black
            man less than the white, and he shoved him aside to
            make room for another trial. Then it was that he
            made the red; and the red man pleased him."</strong></p>
            <p>In this version, the speaker appears much more concerned with the natural world around him beyond humananity. The creator seems to take a more egalitarian view of the Black and white man, though the relegation of the former to a life of labor in both records provides insight into pervasiveness of anti-Blackness in the New World, even among supposed allies. The primary difference in the two accounts is that Irving's story posits white men as the ultimate and favorite creation of God. The other, recorded by M'Kenney and Hall in <em>History of the Indian Tribes of North America,</em> portrays the Native man as the creator's ultimate and favorite child. Irving's depiction of a Seminole origin myth that presupposes its Indigenous storytellers are white supremacists especially stands out as unusual in the context of the proud and valiant history of the Seminoles. Other accounts of the speech indicate that the most common telling places the red man last and in divine favor [citation]. This points to a rearrangement of the truth on Irving's side and appears to be an attempt at promoting white dominance in his literature through the misrepresentation of the Natives as an awaredly-inferior and godforsaken people. His supposed sympathies for the Seminoles thus feel superficial.</p>
            <p>In contrast, few people seemed to harbor as real and ardent an admiration for the Seminoles as did Black Americans, who for decades had been welcomed with open arms to join the Natives when fleeing slavery. Though, like Irving, he never visited Florida, Kentuckian Albery Allson Whitman praised the bravery and sacrifice of the Seminoles in aiding Black maroons in his poem, <em>The Rape of Florida.</em></p>
            <p><strong>"He could not be enslaved–would not enslave<br>The meanest exile that his friendship sued.<br>Brave for himself, defending others brave,<br>The matchless hero of his time he stood,–<br>His noble hear with freedom's love imbued,<br>The strong apostle of Humanity!<br>Mid forests wild and habitations rude,<br>He made his bed of glory by the sea;<br>The friend of Florida and man, there let him be!"</strong></p>
            <p>This poem harkens to a powerful sense of solidarity between Black and Indigenous Floridians, born out of their mutual struggle for survival, autonomy, and joy. Since the peninsula's first settlement to the modern day, Black people living in Florida have been subjected to disproportionately extreme poverty with little government aid or intervention. However, this did not prevent people from creating flourishing communties. In the 1928 essay, <em>How It Feels To Be Colored Me,</em> renowned author Zora Neale Hurston describes some of the conflicting feelings of growing up in the oldest incorporated Black town in the US: Eatonville, Florida.</p>
            <p><strong>"I remember the very day that I became colored. Up to my thirteenth year I lived in the little Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. It is exclusively a colored town. The only white people I knew passed through the town coming or going to Orlando. The native whites rode dusty horses, the Northern tourists chugged down the sandy village road in automobiles. The town knew the Southerners and never stopped cane chewing when they passed. But the Northerners were something else again. They were peered at cautiously from behind curtains by the timid. The more venturesome would come out on the porch to watch them go past and got just as much pleasure out of the tourists as the tourists got out of the village."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>"Someone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the granddaughter of slaves. It fails to register depression with me. Slavery is sixty years in the past. The operation was successful and the patient is doing well, thank you. The terrible struggle that made me an American out of a potential slave said "On the line!" The Reconstruction said "Get set!"; and the generation before said "Go!" I am off to a flying start and must not halt in the stretch to look behind and weep. Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and the choice was not with me. It is a bully adventure and worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it. No one on earth ever had a greater chance for glory. The world to be won and nothing to be lost. It is thrilling to think–to know that for any act of mine, I shall get twice as much praise or twice as much blame. It is quite exciting to hold the center of the national stage, with the spectators not knowing whether to laugh or to weep." (1928)</strong></p>
            <p>Aware of the doubled-pressure of the world's gaze upon her as a Black girl, the narrator basks in the triumphs of her ancestors. She approaches life boldly and jovially, ignoring the prescriptions set out for her by a world that tries to push shame upon her. She claims her Americanness firmly in juxtaposition with the alienating stares of white tourists. Like the Natives before her, she reckons with the dehumanization forced upon her and uses what agency she has to fight back against it. As in older accounts of the pursuit of leisure and vitality in Florida, the disenfranchised nearly becomes an item for the wealthy and transient to oggle, but asserts difference so fiercely that the self becomes reclaimed.</p>
